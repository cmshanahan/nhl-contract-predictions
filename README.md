Predict NHL player contract terms - Galvanize Data Science Immersive Capstone Project


Day 1:
Cleaned contract data obtained via excel sheet from PuckPedia.
Made assumption of $83 million salary cap for 2019 season based on Sportsnet article

Day 2:
Forget everything else you were going to use for stats sources, just use Natural Stat Trick! They provide CSVs!
For now I'm going to limit stats to 'All Situations' for simplicity. Next steps will hopefully involve adding power play / penalty kill.
I got an extremely dumb linear regression model based solely on age and player position. The root mean squared error (RMSE) was 3%, which is also what the standard deviation of my test set was, so yeah, not a great model. But it's something.
Now I need to work on a way to combine the rest of my features and my targets.

Day 3 (or How I learned to stop worrying and love Luongo):
I think the best route for me to go is to implement sklearn's Pipeline somehow. I will also need to have some sort of pandas rolling window setup. I hav ebase data for every player / season combo, and for some of the relative stats I have 3 year windows already setup. A lot of the players in my stats data aren't going to show up anywhere in my contracts data.
I want to use previous contract salary as a feature. If a player has no previous contracts in the data, then assume he was on an ELC (I'm not going to be predicting ELCs.) Median ELC cap_hit in the dataset is $792,500.
I think we'll ignore total career stats for now as the data I have only goes back to 2007 and that won't cover everyone's entire career.
-- Maybe what I'm really after is a radiusneighborsregressor not kNNregressor
Hey I got df.rolling to work!
